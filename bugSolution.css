The solution involves carefully reviewing the CSS selectors and their specificity.  In many cases, restructuring selectors to use more general rules and carefully applying the cascade of styles can solve the problem.  Alternatively, using the `!important` flag (though generally discouraged) can forcibly override styles, but it should be used sparingly.  The `bugSolution.css` file demonstrates a fix by either reorganizing selectors based on their intended priority or by adding more specific selectors to correct the conflict.
