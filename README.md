This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in CSS: specificity issues.  The bug arises from unintentionally overriding styles due to more specific CSS selectors. Debugging specificity problems can be challenging, as they usually don't trigger errors but instead cause unexpected visual inconsistencies.  The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version. This example highlights the importance of understanding CSS selector precedence and using developer tools to inspect element styles effectively.
